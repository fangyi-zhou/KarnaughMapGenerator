# KarnaughMapGenerator
A Karnaugh Map generator for sequential circuit design (with 3 D-flip-flops)

This program allows a transition table and corresponding Karnaugh Map
to be generated for a finite state machine for 3 D-flip-flops.

The state transitions would also depend on one external input (marked as 'IN')
